# Movie Recommendation System Based on Collaborative Filtering
This data science project focuses on developing a movie recommendation system. The system utilizes collaborative filtering, a technique that predicts a user's preferences based on similar patterns from other users. The project leverages a large dataset of user ratings and movie metadata to train a machine learning model.

Key features include user-rating prediction accuracy and personalized recommendation lists. By analyzing user behavior and movie characteristics, the system offers tailored suggestions, enhancing user engagement and satisfaction. This project exemplifies the application of machine learning algorithms to improve content discoverability in digital media platforms.
